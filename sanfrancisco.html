          San Francisco, also known as the "City by the Bay," is a dynamic and iconic city in northern California, USA.
          Renowned for its picturesque landscapes, cultural landmarks, and technological innovation, San Francisco
          stands as a global hub. With over 870,000 people San Francisco is relatively small compared to other major
          cities, but the city is densely populated and culturally rich.
          <br><br>San Francisco was officially incorporated as
          a municipality on April 15, 1850. Situated in the northern part of the state, San Francisco is known for its
          distinctive geography, including the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island, and rolling hills. Predominately
          an urban area, San Francisco does have neighborhoods and areas that can be classified as suburban.
          <br><br>San
          Francisco is a major center for technology and finance, so the average income is relatively high. According
          to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income in San Francisco was around $126,187. The median
          household income in California is around $84,097 (Census Bureau, 2022).

            Bridge, with its International Orange hue, is not just a marvel of engineering but also a symbol of the
            city's bold and vibrant personality.</p>
